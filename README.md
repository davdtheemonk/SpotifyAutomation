# SpotifyAutomation
>Always wanted to automate.

Ive been a fan of online music streaming for quite a while now and can't help it when am busy either studying or writing code,plug in my airpods/earphones and hit the play button.Avoiding distractions has always been hectic,logging in Spotify via my browser because internet is not that good,shuffle next my playlist or play my 5 consecutive favourite Artists.So I wrote this script.
Python Modules I used in this project:

- Selenium
- Time

I used Gecko driver to automate firefox.

clone the package:

```git clone https://github.com/davdtheemonk/SpotifyAutomation.git```

Usage:

input the path to your gecko driver (firefox) or chrome web driver for chrome.

input neccessary login details where required

```cd SpotifyAutomation ```

```python3 SpotifyAuto.py```
